Data and R scripts were used to support the paper:
Yang B, Lessler J, Zhu H, Jiang CQ, Read JM, Hay JA, Kwok KO, Shen R, Guan Y, Riley S, Cummings DA. [Life course exposures continually shape antibody profiles and risk of seroconversion to influenza.] PLoS pathogens. 2020 Jul 23;16(7):e1008635.(https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1008635)

To protect privacy, data on age are in 5-year categories while the original analyses used 1-year resolustion. To repeat some of our analyses, you may need to do resampling of age related variables before running the script.
