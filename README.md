Data and R scripts were used to support the paper:
Yang B, Lessler J, Zhu H, Jiang C, Read JM, Hay JA, Kwok KO, Shen R, Guan Y, Riley S, Cummings DA. Life course exposures continually shape antibody profiles and risk of seroconversion to influenza. PLoS Pathogens. 2020. In press.

To protect privacy, data on age are in 5-year categories while the original analyses used 1-year resolustion. To repeat some of our analyses, you may need to do resampling of age related variables before running the script.
